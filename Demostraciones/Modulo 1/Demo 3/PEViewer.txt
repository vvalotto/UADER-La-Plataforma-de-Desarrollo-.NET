PEViewer Version 1.0 by WangQi(Koms Bomb)
PEViewer.TXT contains details on using PEViewer

1, What's PEViewer?
PEViewer is a GUI tool that can let you dump a PE file structure to several
pages. Its function is like the Borland TDump(a powerful command line tool).
It's written in BCB 5.

2, Disadvantage:
The usage and advantage are in the CHM help file PEViewer.chm. I only show you
the disadvantage of this tool.
1), I've stopped developing this tool.
2), The executable is very big, more than 500KB.
3), It's very slow to display the text in the RichEdit.
4), The resource section it shows is incorrect and it will take long time to show
    the resource. So strongly recommend to turn of the resource panel.
5), There maybe some potential bugs. It's not well tested.
